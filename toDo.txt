monazite creates helium by heat - make this a thing
Titanite (Sphene) comes from titanium ore reduction
anatase, brookite, ilmenite, leucoxene, perovskite, rutile, and sphene. (from titanium ore mining)

"Perovskite is a semiconductor, which is used to transport the electric charge whenever the light hits the material. In the United Kingdom, Oxford University physicists have found that the perovskite has been used as the replacement for thin-film solar cells [12]."
"Omni Crystal" - Crystal product made of every gemstone that's able to be used as any gem (creates 4)
